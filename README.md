# IconicWP Plugin Snippets Repository

Hello, and welcome to the IconicWP Plugin Snippets Repository!

This repository is a valuable resource for developers working with plugins from [IconicWP](https://iconicwp.com/). It's a collection of common code snippets and functions that you might find useful while customizing or extending our plugins.

The snippets are organized by plugin. Each plugin's snippets are located in a dedicated folder, so you can easily find the code that's most relevant to your needs.

## Getting Started

To use these snippets, navigate to the folder of the plugin you're interested in. You'll find a collection of `.php` files, each containing a helpful code snippet for that plugin. Each snippet comes with comments explaining what it does and how to use it.

You can copy these snippets into your own plugin or theme's `functions.php` file. Alternatively, you could use a custom functionality plugin.

Always test on a staging site before adding these snippets to your live site. We are not responsible for any site issues or data loss that may occur as a result of using these snippets.
